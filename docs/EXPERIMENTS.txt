EXPERIMENTS


Architecture ball detector:
	2 layer class and reg
	3 layer class and reg
	comparison 10ts and 20 ts
	
	values
		accuracy for 10 ts and 20 ts


Error vs ts:
	3 layer class
	

Results 3d ball tracker






In the end I want to show these variables dependence on distance and time looking at the ball


Flight vs Roll accuracy
Avg distance in x
Accuracy on in vs out vs almost in
